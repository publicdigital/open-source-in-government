# Open source in government: creating the conditions for success



## Executive summary



## About Public Digital 

Public Digital is a disruptive global consultancy that helps organisations that matter to thrive in the internet era. Public Digital advises leaders in governments and large organisations around the world on how to meet the needs of their citizens/customers through use of the internet. The shorthand for this is digital transformation: how to use the culture, technology, processes, and operating models of the internet era to improve the services they deliver to people. We help governments:



*   set up transformative digital institutions
*   recruit and retain people to fill vital roles within them
*   implement agile, iterative, user-centric policy and service design
*   assess existing technology programmes and capabilities
*   understand and emulate global best practice in digital government

Governments globally have sought to digitise their operations and services for many years. Covid-19 has made this an imperative: countries that have been able to serve their citizens remotely have seen the benefits of their digitisation efforts; those further behind have seen the gap more acutely. 

Adoption of open source software is a powerful tool to accelerate digitisation; it allows governments to share and reuse solutions across borders; to quickly experiment and pilot services without complex and expensive procurement, and then scale at a lower marginal cost. In the best cases, a global community can be created and connected through an open source software project, will share ideas and best practices, and help to deliver more sustainable and flexible services. 

Open source software can also be a powerful lever for change. It can:



*   enable greater digital sovereignty by helping governments to move away contracts where they are locked-in to specific vendors for decades at a time
*   support the development of local or regional digital economies
*   create competition thereby bringing down prices
*   grant governments greater flexibility and control over how their services are delivered. 

Open source software is rightly attracting interest from governments looking to further their nations’ priorities in education, health, civil registration, and financial inclusion. All administrations need to register births, verify identity, track and manage education outcomes, and share data securely between ministries. Open source software offers common solutions to common needs. 

To gain a deeper understanding of governments’ experiences and needs when implementing open source software we conducted 19 interviews across 4 continents. We spoke to a mixture of government decision-makers, technical experts, funders and people delivering digital services to citizens. 

We synthesised their experiences, and set out an **Open Source Capability Model for Governments**[^1] (see page 7-10). It is intended to be a self-assessment tool, assisting governments to adopt open source practices and calibrate their current policy and technical environment. We hope it will help government leaders to identify where they may need additional investment, focus, and training to increase the likelihood of using open source software successfully and sustainably.

**Invest in the conditions for success**

Decision-makers should understand governments’ open source capabilities, using this to prioritise investment in building open source knowledge, skills, and an enabling environment. 

This is especially critical for leaders who want open source software to play a major role in their government’s technology strategy, or those who are planning to use major open source platforms. Our capability model can help governments see where they need to invest in skills and capacity so they can strengthen an open source software implementation.

By investing in capability, and by creating a pathway for the sustainable use of open source software, countries will receive a range of direct and indirect benefits. They will enjoy more strategic control of technology, stronger capabilities for managing a government's technology stack, and ultimately, citizens will enjoy better outcomes and services. 

The decision to use open source software, like any software choice, should be made in terms of the service and strategic outcomes a government intends to achieve.



**We have made a series of recommendations for governments to consider:**

**(1) Policy environment**

Build political consensus and support for open source software adoption, to strengthen long-term sustainability.

Publish and promote a technology strategy for use across government, including clear objectives for open source software. 

**(2) In-house skills and capabilities**

Make a central official or team responsible for setting open source standards and policy, to support and guide its use in government. 

Find champions and develop the government’s internal open source community.

Take steps to encourage reuse within government, including finding opportunities to release publicly-funded code in the open. 

**(3) Open source vendor ecosystem**

Review procurement policies and practices to ensure they aren’t inadvertently blocking open source software. 

In the longer term, develop a range of appropriate procurement options for buying software and related services.

Grow and support the local ecosystem of vendors, including promoting new business and delivery models built around open source software.

**(4) Sustainability**

Evaluate the short and long term costs of open source software projects, using early experiments and pilots to understand the implementation, maintenance and support costs of the service. 

Consider and evaluate what ownership and support model will be needed to support your implementation

Contribute to the open source community: share experiences in the open, support the development of local technical expertise and contribute practically by encouraging contributions to open source projects.

Open source software is a powerful way to accelerate digitisation, and to make the most of this opportunity a government needs to take a holistic approach which considers the skills and capabilities within government and the wider economy. 

Refer to our longer report, “Open source in government: creating the conditions for success” for a full and detailed explanation of the model. We hope these recommendations and our model can be a useful tool for decision-makers who plan to implement large scale open source platforms. We also hope that the insight and advice for governments will be helpful to funders and open source software providers when working with countries to implement new and better services for citizens through open source software.
